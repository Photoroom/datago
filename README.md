# datago

A golang-based data loader which can be used from Python. Compatible with a soon-to-be open sourced VectorDB-enabled data stack, which exposes HTTP requests.

Datago handles, outside of the Python GIL

- per sample IO from object storage
- deserialization (jpg and png decompression)
- some optional vision processing (aligning different image payloads)
- optional serialization

Samples are exposed in the Python scope as python native objects, using PIL and Numpy base types.
Speed will be network dependent, but GB/s is typical.

Datago is rank and world-size aware, in which case the samples are dispatched depending on the samples hash.

<details> <summary><strong>Use it</strong></summary>

## Use the package from Python

```python
from datago import datago

config = datago.GetDefaultConfig()
# Check out the config fields, plenty of option to specify your DB query and optimize performance

client = datago.GetClient(config)
client.Start()  # This can be done early for convenience, not mandatory (can fetch samples while models are instanciated for intance)

for _ in range(10):
    sample = client.GetSample() # This start the client if not previously done, in that case latency for the first sample is higher
```

Please note that the image buffers will be passed around as raw pointers, they can be re-interpreted in python with the attached helpers

## Match the raw exported buffers with typical python types

See helper functions provided in `polyglot.py`, should be self explanatory

## Install deps

```bash
$ sudo apt install golang libjpeg-turbo8-dev libvips-dev
$ sudo ldconfig
```

## Build a benchmark CLI

From the root of this project:

```bash
$ go build cmd/main/main.go
```

Running it:

```bash
$ ./main --help` will tell you all about it
```

Running it with additional sanity checks

```bash
$ go run -race cmd/main/main.go
```

## Run the go test suite

From the root folder

```bash
$ go test -v tests/client_test.go
```

## Refresh the python package and its binaries

- Install the dependencies as detailed in the next point
- Run the `generate_python_package.sh` script

## Generate the python package binaries manually

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pybindgen
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
$ go install github.com/go-python/gopy@latest
$ go install golang.org/x/image/draw
```

NOTE:

- you may need to add `~/go/bin` to your PATH so that gopy is found.
- - Either `export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin` or add it to your .bashrc
- you may need this to make sure that LDD looks at the current folder `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.`

then from the /pkg folder:

```bash
$ gopy pkg -author="Photoroom" -email="team@photoroom.com" -url="" -name="datago" -version="0.0.1" .
```

then you can `pip install -e .` from here.

## Update the pypi release (maintainers)

```
python3 setup.py sdist
python3 -m twine upload dist/* --verbose
```
