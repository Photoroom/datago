datago
======

A golang-based data loader which can be used from Python. Compatible with a soon-to-be open sourced VectorDB-enabled data stack, which exposes HTTP requests.

Datago will handle, outside of the Python GIL
- per sample IO from object storage
- deserialization
- some optional vision processing (aligning different image payloads)
- serialization

Samples are then exposed in the Python scope and ready for consumption, typically using PIL and Numpy base types.
Speed will be network dependent, but GB/s is relatively easily possible

Datago can be rank and world-size aware, in which case the samples are dispatched depending on the samples hash.

<details> <summary><strong>Use it</strong></summary>

Use the package from Python
---------------------------

```python
from datago import datago

# source, has/lacks attributes, has/lacks masks, has/lacks latents, metadata prefetch, sample prefetch, concurrent download
client = datago.GetClient(
            source="SOURCE",
            require_images=True,
            has_attributes="",
            lacks_attributes="",
            has_masks="",
            lacks_masks="",
            has_latents="",
            lacks_latents="",
            crop_and_resize=True,
            prefetch_buffer_size=64,
            samples_buffer_size=64,
            downloads_concurrency=64,
        )

client.Start()  # This can be done early for convenience, not mandatory (can fetch samples while models are instanciated for intance)

for _ in range(10):
    sample = client.GetSample() # This start the client if not previously done, in that case latency for the first sample is higher
```

Please note that the image buffers will be passed around as raw pointers, they can be re-interpreted in python with the attached helpers


Match the raw exported buffers with typical python types
--------------------------------------------------------

See helper functions provided in `polyglot.py`, should be self explanatory

Install deps
------------

```bash
$ sudo apt install golang libjpeg-turbo8-dev libvips-dev
$ sudo ldconfig
```

Build a benchmark CLI
---------------------

From the root of this project `datago_src`:

```bash
$ go build cmd/main/main.go
```

Running it:

```bash
$ ./main --help` will tell you all about it
```

Running it with additional sanity checks

```bash
$ go run -race cmd/main/main.go
```

Run the go test suite
---------------------

From the src folder

```bash
$ go test -v tests/client_test.go
```

Refresh the python package and its binaries
-------------------------------------------

- Install the dependencies as detailed in the next point
- Run the `generate_python_package.sh` script

Generate the python package binaries manually
---------------------------------------------

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pybindgen
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
$ go install github.com/go-python/gopy@latest
$ go install golang.org/x/image/draw
```

NOTE:
- you may need to add `~/go/bin` to your PATH so that gopy is found.
- - Either `export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin` or add it to your .bashrc
- you may need this to make sure that LDD looks at the current folder `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.`

then from the /pkg/client folder:

```bash
$ gopy pkg -author="Photoroom" -email="team@photoroom.com" -url="" -name="datago" -version="0.0.1" .
```

then you can `pip install -e .` from here.


Update the pypi release (maintainers)
-------------------------------------
```
python3 setup.py sdist
python3 -m twine upload dist/* --verbose
```
