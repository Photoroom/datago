# datago

A golang-based data loader which can be used from Python. Compatible with a [soon-to-be open sourced](https://github.com/Photoroom/dataroom) VectorDB-enabled data stack, which exposes HTTP requests, and with a local filesystem, more front-ends are possible. Focused on image data at the moment, could also easily be more generic.

Datago handles, outside of the Python GIL

- per sample IO
- deserialization (jpg and png decompression)
- some optional vision processing (aligning different image payloads)
- optional serialization

Samples are exposed in the Python scope as python native objects, using PIL and Numpy base types.
Speed will be network dependent, but GB/s is typical.

Depending on the front ends, datago can be rank and world-size aware, in which case the samples are dispatched depending on the samples hash. Only an iterator is exposed at the moment, but a map interface wouldn't be too hard.

<details> <summary><strong>Use it</strong></summary>

## Use the package from Python

```python
from datago import datago
import json

client_config = {
    # two sources are supported at the moment, DB (API and stack to be shared) & local filesystem
    # in the case of the filesystem, datago will serve the jpg/png files, ID being filepath
    "source_type": datago.SourceTypeFileSystem,
    "source_config": {
        "page_size": 512,
        "root_path": root_path,
    },
    # this governs the image pre-processing, which will resize and crop to aspect ratio buckets
    # resizing is high quality by default
    "image_config": {
        "crop_and_resize": crop_and_resize,
        "default_image_size": 512,
        "downsampling_ratio": 16,
        "min_aspect_ratio": 0.5,
        "max_aspect_ratio": 2.0,
        "pre_encode_images": False,
    },
    # some performance options, best settings will depend on your machine
    "prefetch_buffer_size": 64,
    "samples_buffer_size": 128,
    "concurrency": concurrency,
}

client = datago.GetClientFromJSON(json.dumps(config))
client.Start()  # This can be done early for convenience, not mandatory

for _ in range(10):
    sample = client.GetSample()
```

Please note that the image buffers will be passed around as raw pointers, see below.

## Match the raw exported buffers with typical python types

See helper functions provided in `types.py`, should be self explanatory. Check python benchmarks for examples.

## Install deps

```bash
$ sudo apt install golang libjpeg-turbo8-dev libvips-dev
$ sudo ldconfig
```

## Build a benchmark CLI

From the root of this project:

```bash
$ go build cmd/main.go
```

Running it:

```bash
$ ./main --help` will tell you all about it
```

Running it with additional sanity checks

```bash
$ go run -race cmd/main/main.go
```

## Run the go test suite

From the root folder

```bash
$ go test -v tests/client_test.go
```

## Refresh the python package and its binaries

- Install the dependencies as detailed in the next point
- Run the `generate_python_package.sh` script

## Generate the python package binaries manually

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install pybindgen
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
$ go install github.com/go-python/gopy@latest
$ go install golang.org/x/image/draw
```

NOTE:

- you may need to add `~/go/bin` to your PATH so that gopy is found.
- - Either `export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin` or add it to your .bashrc
- you may need this to make sure that LDD looks at the current folder `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.`

then from the /pkg folder:

```bash
$ gopy pkg -author="Photoroom" -email="team@photoroom.com" -url="" -name="datago" -version="0.0.1" .
```

then you can `pip install -e .` from here.

## Update the pypi release (maintainers)

```
python3 setup.py sdist
python3 -m twine upload dist/* --verbose
```
